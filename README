Common Module
-------------

The common module installs various functions that are required by other
modules. This module should be installed before any of the other module.

! Upgrade Notices !

The old way of using the common module required that you add 'import common' to
a modules.pp file that you included from site.pp. This is no longer the way to
do it, and will not work (the import keyword is deprecated and will be removed
in puppet 4), also you will get this error if you are doing this:

Could not parse for environment production: No file(s) found for import of 'common'

The module_{dir,file} have been moved to common::module_{dir,file} - you will
need to change all occurances in your manifests to match the new format

The replace and delete_lines functions have been removed, you can use file_line
from stdlib instead.

The 'append_if_no_such_line' define has been replaced with the 'line' define. If
you are using 'append_if_no_such_line' anywhere in your manifests, you will need
to transition to 'line' before upgrading to this version of the common
module. The 'line' define is a drop-in replacement and essentially equivalent,
so the transition is quite easy, you should only simply need to change the name
in your manifests.
